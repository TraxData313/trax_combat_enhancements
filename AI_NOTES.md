# AI notes

Claude's detail companion to TASKS_TODO.md — one section per BUILD ORDER step. Read the
step's section before starting it; leave it richer than you found it.

## Step 2 — Research (no code)

Goal: every hook the mod needs, verified against the **v1.4.8** decompiled game
(`..\reference\game-decompiled\`, decompile more assemblies beside it when needed), written
to `docs/RESEARCH.md` — per question: the verified answer with source file references, the
recommended approach, the risks. If something in DESIGN.md turns out infeasible or costly,
say so there and propose the nearest good alternative.

Questions:

- **A. Damage** — where is a landed hit's FINAL damage (after armor) computed, for people
  and horses, melee and missiles? Is it a game model (AgentApplyDamageModel?) registered in
  BOTH the campaign and custom battle, and can we DECORATE it (does v1.4.8 hand us the
  previously registered model)? If not, the cleanest Harmony point.
- **B. Detecting a blow** — the cheapest reliable signal that a fighter RELEASED an attack,
  landed or not: melee swing/thrust, bow, crossbow, throw — for AI and player alike, with
  1000 agents. And the signal for a LANDED blow (incl. one that hit a shield / was parried).
- **C. Slowing attacks** — which AgentDrivenProperties govern melee swing, thrust, bow draw,
  crossbow reload, throw speed; where they are computed (AgentStatCalculateModel?); how to
  apply a temporary ×0.2 to ONE agent and remove it again, surviving the game's own
  recomputes (weapon switch, etc.). Does the engine clamp the multiplier?
- **D. Movement** — agent speed on foot and on horseback for the standing/moving regen rule.
- **E. Hero / party leader** — from an Agent: is it a hero, and is it the leader of its own
  party (campaign: agent origin → party → LeaderHero). What to do in custom battle.
- **F. Mission lifecycle** — adding our MissionBehavior to every combat mission (field,
  siege, hideout, arena/tournament, custom battle); agent spawn/remove events; cheapest
  per-agent state storage.
- **G. HUD** — how vanilla shows the player's health (VM + prefab) and how we add our own
  bar near it (own GauntletLayer in a MissionView? no UIExtenderEx if avoidable); world →
  screen projection for bars floating above formations; which agent the player is
  looking/aiming at; the orders-menu formation cards (VM + prefab) and whether adding to
  them needs UIExtenderEx (+ Harmony/ButterLib) — cost of that dependency vs alternatives.
  Is RCM in the Workshop folder? Where/how its posture bar sits (style reference only).
- **H. Config + MCM** — MCM v5's fluent builder (verify the API against the MCM DLLs in
  Workshop item 2859238197) used from method bodies only, so the mod loads WITHOUT MCM;
  compare with the sibling bridges (`..\ImmersiveAI`, `..\TrainingBattlesMod\...\Mcm`).
  Config file format: is Newtonsoft.Json shipped with the game, and can it read a JSON file
  with `//` comments (the instructions beside each value)?
- **I. Harmony** — is it needed at all after A–H? Prefer not.

Answered in `docs/RESEARCH.md` (A–I, plus J hot swap and K logging, added mid-step at
Anton's request). Verdict: no Harmony, no UIExtenderEx; 13 design implications for Anton at
the top of RESEARCH.

## Step 3 — Scaffold (DONE 2026-09-27)

**Built** (file map in CLAUDE.md "Layout"): solution + `Directory.Build.props` (`*.user`
import); Core (schema of all 32 DESIGN settings, `TraxSettings.Shared`, config-file text,
merge rule, edit tracker, rate limiter) + 53 xUnit tests; Module `TraxCombatEnhancements.dll`
(SubModule, ModPaths, ConfigStore, TraxLog, McmBridge, two pass-through decorators,
AthleticsLogic stub); `module/SubModule.xml` v0.1.0; `tools/deploy.ps1` (build → AssemblyGuard
→ OfflineSmoke → install as `Modules\TraxCombatEnhancements.Dev`); `tools/AssemblyGuard`;
`tools/OfflineSmoke` (16 checks, see below). PLAYTEST §1 written.

**How later steps use it**
- Read settings AT USE TIME: `TraxSettings.Shared.DamageRandomPercent` etc. (typed property per
  key). Never copy into a field at mission start. To rebuild on change: subscribe
  `TraxSettings.Shared.Changed` (raised on the setter's thread, main thread in practice) or
  compare `TraxSettings.Shared.Version`.
- A NEW setting = a row in DESIGN's table + an entry in `SettingsSchema` (right group, right
  place — file and MCM order follow it) + a typed property on `TraxSettings` + (since step 5b)
  `"Key": value` in defaults.json, then the DefaultsTool refresh. `SchemaTests` and
  `DefaultsFileTests` fail until all four agree; the file and the MCM page pick it up by themselves; an old
  config.json gets the new key written in at the next read (logged).
- Log: `TraxLog.Info(tag, msg)`; chatty lines `if (TraxLog.VerboseOn) TraxLog.Verbose(tag, msg)`
  (check VerboseOn FIRST so the hot path builds no strings); `TraxLog.Error("area.hook", e)` in
  every catch. Tags in TraxLog's class doc.
- Summary: `AthleticsLogic.WriteSummary` has the marked spot for step 4/5 lines.
- Offline checks: add to `tools/OfflineSmoke/Program.cs` whatever can run without the game
  (it already loads the game's DLLs on .NET Framework; pure managed game types can be
  constructed, e.g. `new TraxAgentStatModel(...)`).

**Decisions**
- **THE FILE-REWRITE RULE** (`Core/ConfigMerge.cs`, tested + smoke): when the mod writes
  config.json while one exists (MCM Done; adding missing keys), it RE-READS the disk file at
  that moment; per setting — changed in MCM since the last write → memory's value; else a
  valid value on disk → the disk's value (a hand edit made while the game runs survives, and
  applies at the next battle start); else memory. Unknown keys carried in a trailing "Not
  recognised" section. "Changed in MCM" = live value differs from the value before the first
  MCM edit (`EditTracker`), so a slider moved and moved back, or MCM's Cancel, never overwrites
  a hand edit. A disk file that does not parse → copied to `config.json.broken-<time>`, then
  written fresh from memory. At a read, the file is rewritten only when keys are MISSING and
  nothing is invalid (an invalid hand value is left for the player to see in the log). Own
  `//` comments are not preserved (the header says so). Writes via temp file + replace.
- **Reads**: startup, every game start/load (`OnGameStart`), every mission start
  (`OnMissionBehaviorInitialize`, before AthleticsLogic attaches). Missing/invalid key →
  default. Before a re-read, MCM edits that never reached the disk are written first.
- **MCM "default" preset kept and filled with DESIGN's defaults** (RESEARCH §H said remove
  it — wrong: MCM.UI's page Reset and per-setting reset apply the preset with id "default";
  without it Reset silently does nothing). `CreatePreset("default", …)` BEFORE `BuildAsGlobal`
  wins because MCM's preset builder keeps the first value per key. Verified offline.
- **No lambdas with MCM-typed parameters** (they compile to a cached static field typed on MCM
  → the load trap; RESEARCH §H's sample would have failed the guard — proven with a probe
  DLL). Builder callbacks are instance methods `Fill(object)` passed as `Action<object>`
  (contravariance). The built settings are held as `object`. Guard: 0 errors, 0 warnings.
- Float settings stored rounded to 4 decimals (MCM's 0.1f → 0.1); ints rounded; all as
  doubles in one array. Ranges chosen per setting (see `SettingsSchema`), e.g.
  `ExhaustedAttackSpeedPercent` 5–100 (0 could freeze an animation), `ExhaustedRecoverPercent`
  0–90, `MaxAthletics` 10–1000. Every setting is `ApplyTiming.Live` (a test enforces it; a
  NextBattle one must be a deliberate exception).
- `ConfigVersion: 1` stamp in the file (meta, not a setting) — bump + migrate if a later step
  must change the meaning or push a new default into existing files (every key is written, so
  a changed default does NOT reach an existing file otherwise).
- Error handling: every game hook try/catch → `[error]` with stack, rate-limited per place
  (3 stacks, then one per 10 s, counts reported); a red in-game line at most every 30 s
  (queued, shown from `OnApplicationTick` = main thread). Verbose: 40-line burst, 20/s per tag.
- RBM (manager commit f7dc70c, DESIGN §5): `[compat]` line at every load; if module id `RBM` or
  `RBM_*` is enabled, ONE yellow message per session (main menu, else game start).
- Deploy ships the `.pdb` files (line numbers in `[error]` stacks), never Newtonsoft.Json (the
  game's own 13.0.0.0 is used; Core compiles against the 13.0.1 package — same identity).

**Gotchas**
- `TaleWorlds.Engine.Path` clashes with `System.IO.Path` — alias it (`using Path = System.IO.Path;`).
- MCM needs `0Harmony` at run time (its wrappers use HarmonyLib extensions) — in game the
  Bannerlord.Harmony module provides it; the offline smoke resolves it from Workshop 2859188632.
- MCM's `ISettingsPropertyGroupBuilder` keys properties by DISPLAY NAME: labels must be unique
  within a group (tested). Group names must not contain `/` (sub-group delimiter; tested).
- `ProxyRef<T>` silently ignores a value of the wrong CLR type (`value is T`): bool/int/float
  exactly — the preset boxes each default as its setting's type.
- The informational version carries `+<git commit>` of HEAD at build time (SDK SourceLink):
  the `[load]` line says which build Anton runs — deploy AFTER the final commit.
- Windows PowerShell 5.1 runs `deploy.ps1`: keep it ASCII; manifest read/written with explicit UTF-8.

**UNVERIFIED — only the game can tell (PLAYTEST §1 has the lines that prove each)**
1. The mod loads in the launcher/game, with MCM and without (GetTypes() without MCM passes
   offline on .NET Framework with the real game DLLs; the real module loader is not run).
2. `EngineFilePaths.ConfigsPath` resolves to `Documents\Mount and Blade II Bannerlord\Configs`
   in game (fallback path logged if not).
3. MCM registration timing: `BaseSettingsBuilder.Create` non-null at the main menu or within
   the 1 s retries; the page appears in Mod Options with 7 groups / 32 settings (since 5b: 8 groups / 33
   settings + the "Defaults" buttons) (built and
   inspected offline through MCM's real builder + discoverer, but not the Gauntlet UI).
4. MCM opened from the Escape menu MID-BATTLE edits live values; Done raises SAVE_TRIGGERED
   in game (the container path is decompiled, not run); slider drags log every step.
5. The two decorators register over the expected base models in campaign, custom battle and
   War Sails games, and vanilla combat is unchanged (pass-through).
6. The tournament AI-level fix in a real tournament (mechanics verified offline).
7. `OnEndMissionInternal` → `[summary]` for every ending (victory, defeat, retreat, leaving a
   town scene); `Mission.CombatType` / `Mode` values at AfterStart.
8. `Utilities.GetModulesNames()` at OnSubModuleLoad (module list + RBM detection).
9. `InformationManager.DisplayMessage` at the main menu (load line, RBM line, error line).

## Step 4 — Damage randomness (DONE 2026-09-27)

**Built** (file map in CLAUDE.md "Layout"): Core `RandomSource.cs` (IRandomSource,
ThreadSafeRandom, SeededRandom), `DamageRoll.cs` (HitFacts, DamageRules, Decide, Factor,
Apply, Roll, GameRound), `DamageStats.cs` (per-mission stats + summary text) + 39 tests (92
total, incl. a 200k-roll distribution check: bounds, mean, flat histogram). Module
`Models/DamageRandomizer.cs` + `TraxDamageModel.ApplyGeneralDamageModifiers` (the only
non-forwarding member); `AthleticsLogic.AfterStart` → `DamageRandomizer.OnMissionStart()`,
`WriteSummary` → `DamageRandomizer.WriteSummary()` (own try). `TraxLog.Verbose(tag, msg,
bucket)` overload. OfflineSmoke +6 checks (22) in `Program.Damage.cs`. PLAYTEST §2.

**The flow per hit** (main thread): `BaseModel.ApplyGeneralDamageModifiers` (outside our try —
its exceptions are the game's own) → `HitFacts` from `cd.IsColliderAgent`,
`ai.IsVictimAgentNull`, `cd.IsFallDamage`, `cd.AttackBlockedWithShield`, `cd.IsMissile`,
`ai.IsVictimAgentMount`, `cd.IsHorseCharge` → `DamageRules.From(TraxSettings.Shared)` (live) →
`Decide` → skip (counted, verbose line in bucket `damage-skip`) or `Roll` (counted, first roll
per mission always logged with its thread, verbose line otherwise) → the game rounds our value.

**Decisions**
- **Skip order** (first match wins, each counted by reason): object (not an agent collider) →
  no victim → fall → the game's value rounds to 0 → master switch → spread 0 → shield toggle →
  mount toggle → melee/ranged toggle. Target toggles (shield, mount) and attack toggles
  (melee/ranged) COMBINE: an arrow into a horse rolls only with Ranged AND OnMounts on.
- **Category** for the stats is exclusive: shield → mount → ranged → melee. Horse charge =
  melee (follows `DamageRandomMelee`). Kicks/bashes (`IsAlternativeAttack`) = melee, rolled.
  Missile area damage and siege-engine shots at people = ranged (they are `IsMissile`).
  Friendly fire rolls too (a landed strike); its verbose line says "friendly fire".
- **Rounding rule, precisely**: the game does `(int)Math.Round(x)` (banker's: 0.5 → 0, 2.5 → 2).
  "0 stays 0" = if the game's value would SHOW as 0 (x ≤ 0.5) we return it untouched; else
  `max(1, x·f)`. Factor = 1 − p + 2p·u with u ∈ [0,1) → [1 − p, 1 + p); the top is never quite
  reached (fine). p = 100 can draw ~0 → floor 1.
- **Errors**: our part throws → the game's value; `DamageStats.AddError(site)` is true only the
  first time per site per mission → that one goes to `TraxLog.Error` (stack + red in-game line),
  the rest are counted in the summary ("damage roll errors: N (damage.roll N)"). Sites:
  `damage.roll` (the hook), `damage.log` (building a log line — the roll still stands),
  `damage.mission-start`, `damage.summary`.
- **Thread**: verified from source — every hit callback is `[MBCallback(null, false)]`
  (not multi-thread callable) → main thread (RESEARCH §A updated). Still: dice per thread,
  stats under one uncontended lock, and every roll compares its thread with the one
  `OnMissionStart` ran on → summary "ran on the main thread: all N" or "OFF the main thread".
- **No new parameters.** The histogram's 10 slices and the verbose bucket name are log
  plumbing, not gameplay numbers.
- Implications 2–4 of RESEARCH (knockdown follows the roll; shields not rolled by default;
  charge = melee, fall/objects never) are already in DESIGN §1 and Interpretation 9; the code
  follows them. DESIGN unchanged in this step.

**Gotchas**
- `AttackCollisionData` has private fields; offline it is built with the game's public
  `AttackCollisionData.GetAttackCollisionDataForDebugPurpose(...)` (IsHorseCharge =
  ChargeVelocity > 0, IsFallDamage = FallSpeed > 0). `AttackInformation` has public fields —
  `new AttackInformation { IsVictimAgentNull = …, IsVictimAgentMount = … }` works offline.
  `CustomAgentApplyDamageModel.ApplyGeneralDamageModifiers` returns its input → a clean base
  for offline checks (`model.Initialize(base)` sets BaseModel).
- The verbose limiter is keyed by bucket: a flood in one bucket (the smoke's flood check)
  empties it for ~2 s — the smoke sleeps 1 s before its verbose checks.
- The game's combat log already shows "Extra damage from skills, perks and effects: N" /
  "Reduced damage…" whenever `CalculateDamage` changes the value (`combatLog.ModifiedDamage`) —
  our roll shows up there, mixed with perks.
- `Agent.Name` allocates (TextObject.ToString) — only in the verbose/first-roll path.

**UNVERIFIED — only the game can tell (PLAYTEST §2 has the lines)**
1. The engine calls our `ApplyGeneralDamageModifiers` for every landed hit in campaign,
   custom battle and naval battles (`[damage] first roll this mission` line).
2. Hit callbacks on the main thread (source says so; the first-roll line proves it).
3. Shield HP: the native `Agent.OnShieldDamaged(slot, inflictedDamage)` uses the collision's
   (rolled) InflictedDamage — only matters with `DamageRandomOnShields` on.
4. Object hits (gates, siege engines) really reach the model as `!IsColliderAgent` (counted as
   "objects") — source says `GetAttackCollisionResults` runs for them with damage > 0.
5. Names in the verbose line for the player, mounts (`horse X of Y`) and missiles (the missile
   item) read well in game.
6. Combined with other damage mods (only RBM is declared incompatible): the summary's before →
   after is the tool.

## Step 5 — Endurance core (DONE 2026-09-27; renamed Athletics in step 5b - names below are the new ones)

**Built** (file map in CLAUDE.md "Layout"): Core `Athletics.cs` (AthleticsRules, Fighter,
AthleticsMath), `SpreadStats.cs` (MeanStd, FormationAthleticsStats, IntervalStats,
SpeedVerdict), `AthleticsStats.cs` (per-mission counters + summary text) + 30 tests (122).
Module: `AthleticsLogic` as 4 partial files (lifecycle / Engine / Api / Log), `TrackedAgent`,
`Models/SpeedPenalty.cs`, `TraxAgentStatModel.UpdateAgentStats` (the one non-forwarding
change), `TraxLog.Limited`. OfflineSmoke +6 checks (28) in `Program.Athletics.cs`. PLAYTEST §3.

**The flow** (all main thread):
- Spawn: `OnAgentBuild` → `Track` (humans only; mounts never) → hero / leader flags cached.
  First tick: `SweepAgents` picks up anyone spawned before us.
- Tick (`TickAthletics`): settings version changed → `ApplySettingsChange`; for every tracked
  active fighter one native `GetCurrentActionType(1)` → on a change `ObserveAction` (rising edge
  into ReleaseMelee = `StartRelease` → `Charge`; falling edge = swing length; ReleaseRanged /
  ReleaseThrowing / Kick / WeaponBash only counted); `SpeedDirty` → `UpdateAgentProperties()`;
  every 0.1 s `RegenPass`; every `FormationStatsRefreshSeconds` `RefreshFormationStats`.
- Events: `OnMeleeHit` (couched/braced charge, the release check, landed-only melee),
  `OnAgentShootMissile` (ranged charge, 0.1 s dedupe, remembers the missile index),
  `OnMissileHit` (landed-only ranged).
- `Charge` → Core `AthleticsMath.Charge` → stats → `RetargetSpeed` (new multiplier? mark
  dirty) → `OnExhausted`. Regen → `OnRecovered` (retarget) / `OnRefilled`.
- Decorator: `BaseModel.UpdateAgentStats` → `AthleticsLogic.SpeedMultiplierFor(agent)` (1 for
  untracked / no mission / AthleticsEnabled off) → `SpeedPenalty.Scale`.

**Decisions**
- **State = FRACTION of the pool** (`Fighter.Fraction`, 1 = full): "MaxAthletics change keeps
  each fighter's fraction" holds by construction; points = fraction × `PoolPoints`.
- **One pure function per rule** (manager's heads-up for Athletics v2, DESIGN §2b):
  `AthleticsMath.PoolPoints(r, f)`, `BlowCostPoints`, `RegenFractionPerSecond(r, f, speed,
  topSpeed)` (top speed already passed, unused by §2), `AttackSpeedMultiplier` (a float per
  fighter), `IsExhausted`. 5c changes those bodies, not the plumbing.
- **Speed = a float per fighter** (`Fighter.SpeedMultiplier`) that the decorator applies on
  EVERY recompute. The logic re-targets it on a charge, a recovery or a setting change and asks
  for `UpdateAgentProperties()` only when it moved by `SpeedUpdateStep` (0.02) or to/from 1 —
  §2's cliff flips twice per exhaustion; 5c's line will move in small steps.
- **`UpdateAgentProperties()` only from the tick**, never inside an engine hit callback (not
  proven unsafe - just not risked): ≤ 1 frame late.
- **Poll every tick, not throttled**: release phases of fast weapons can be short; the cost is
  measured (`Athletics tick cost`). Fallback if it shows: `AgentComponent.OnTickParallel`.
- **Regen every 0.1 s**, only fighters below full or exhausted (a full fighter costs nothing, no
  native call). The integration is exact (only the part of the step after the delay counts); the
  moving sample and recovery are 0.1 s coarse. Moving = `(MountAgent ?? agent).MovementVelocity`.
- **Recovery is checked every regen step** even without a gain, so a lowered
  `ExhaustedRecoverPercent` applies at once.
- **Hit before the poll saw the release**: `OnMeleeHit` reads the action itself and runs the same
  `ObserveAction`. A hit counts "in a counted release" if we were in one until now (the engine may
  already be in the blocked/parried reaction) or the action is a release now.
- **Landed-only melee** (`CostOnMiss` off): first hit on an agent per swing, keyed on the swing
  counter (`ReleaseSerial` vs `LandedSerial`); a hit outside any release charges at most once per
  `BlowTimeSeconds` (counted as "time fallback"). A release charged in on-miss mode marks its
  serial, so switching modes mid-swing never charges twice.
- **Landed-only ranged**: the shooter's own last 4 missile indices (`MissilesList`'s last entry at
  `OnAgentShootMissile` - the game adds it right before calling behaviours); siege-engine
  missiles never get there; a multi-penetration missile charges once.
- **Couched lance / braced spear**: `IsDoingPassiveAttack` in `OnMeleeHit`, victim ≠ null, at
  most one per `BlowTimeSeconds` (a couch through two men = one blow). Horse-charge bumps
  (`IsHorseCharge`) and kicks / bashes (`IsAlternativeAttack`) are free.
- **AthleticsEnabled off mid-battle**: `ResetFull()` everyone + retarget (penalties lifted on the
  next tick); the decorator ALSO checks the flag live (fail safe). On again: everyone full.
- **Leaders**: campaign = `(Origin.BattleCombatant as PartyBase).LeaderHero.CharacterObject ==
  agent.Character`; no campaign = `BattleCombatant.General == agent.Character`, a side without a
  general → its heroes. A leader who is not a hero (defensive) gets the leader factor alone.
- "Athletics spent" = points really drained (a swing at 0 drains nothing).
- **The attack-speed measurement** (the engine-clamp question): melee time between releases,
  ranged time between shots, and the length of swings that hit NOTHING (purest - a hit cuts the
  animation short); each classified by the penalty at both ends (a change in between → left out);
  0.05 s histogram up to 30 s; verdict "ARE slower" at ≥ x1.5 the fresh median.
- Always-on lines: the player's own exhaustion / recovery / back-to-full and each party leader
  at spawn (`TraxLog.Limited`, own buckets); everyone else's in verbose buckets
  (athletics-blow, -exhaust, -regen, -hero, speed-update).
- **No new parameters.** 0.1 s regen step, 0.1 s shot dedupe, 0.02 speed step, 30 s interval
  cap, x1.5 verdict are engine/log plumbing. DESIGN unchanged.

**Gotchas**
- **Agent's static initializer calls the engine** (`DefaultTauntActions` → `ActionIndexCache` →
  `MBAnimation`). Offline: never touch an Agent STATIC field; `FieldInfo.SetValue` on an Agent
  INSTANCE runs the type initializer too (and breaks the type for the process) - the smoke sets
  backing fields with IL `stfld` (`FieldSetter`). `FormatterServices.GetUninitializedObject`
  is fine.
- **`Agent.IsActive()` and `GetMaximumForwardUnlimitedSpeed()` are raw pointer reads**
  (`AgentHelper`): on an uninitialized agent = access violation (uncatchable crash). Offline
  paths avoid them (`WriteAthleticsSummary` samples speeds only with a Mission).
- `ActionCodeType`, `FormationClass` and `DrivenProperty` have ALIAS values - `ToString()` may
  print `AttackMeleeAllBegin` / `NumberOfDefaultFormations`. Names come from a fixed table
  (formations: "1 Infantry"… as the game numbers them) or the first declared field.
- Sandbox's and CustomBattle's `UpdateHumanStats` assign the three speed values with `=` on
  every recompute → scaling after the base never compounds. A base model that multiplied instead
  would compound - the first-exhaustion log would show a ratio ≠ the asked one.
- There is NO native getter for driven properties: "the penalty is in the agent's properties"
  proves the managed side (what we send); only the timing check proves the engine uses it.
- .NET Framework (the game, the smoke) formats midpoints differently from .NET 8 (the tests):
  the smoke asserts text prefixes around such numbers.

**For step 5c** (manager asked; verified in source, values UNVERIFIED in game) - DONE in step 5c,
see its section (kept for the trail)
- (Step 5b) Names are Athletics now; new keys go into defaults.json as well (see "Step 5b"); the
  run-speed and damage-upside levers must respect `r.Enabled` (= ModEnabled && AthleticsEnabled)
  and give back vanilla speed / damage when it is false.
- Top speed: `agent.GetMaximumForwardUnlimitedSpeed()` - pointer read, cheap; for a rider use
  the mount's. Speed: `(MountAgent ?? agent).MovementVelocity.Length` (native, m/s).
- Walk speed: `agent.WalkSpeedCached` (managed) = the mount's `WalkingSpeedLimitOfMountable`
  (native) or `Monster.WalkingSpeedLimit` - `Modules\Native\ModuleData\monsters.xml`: human
  1.8 m/s (human_settlement 1.4, child 1.6). The summary's `speeds for step 5c` line measures
  walk vs top on foot and for horses every mission, plus a histogram of speed ÷ top speed seen
  while refilling (tenths, "above 1" = faster than the "top"). That gives `WalkEffortFraction`.
- Run-speed lever: driven properties `MaxSpeedMultiplier` (87) / `CombatMaxSpeedMultiplier` (88)
  in the same decorator (same pattern as the attack speed). `Agent.SetMaximumSpeedLimit` is the
  formation movement's own lever - avoid it.
- Per-fighter pool (Athletics, DESIGN §2b as revised in 11edf4f): cache the skill on the record at
  `Track` (e.g. `GetEffectiveSkill(agent, DefaultSkills.Athletics)` through the stat model) and
  make `AthleticsMath.PoolPoints(r, f)` read it; the fraction store already keeps each share when
  the pool changes. Health cap: clamp `Fraction` to health left in the regen step and on a hit.
- Damage upside from the ATTACKER's Athletics: the damage decorator can call
  `AthleticsLogic.TryGetReading(attacker, out var r)` (the rider for a horse charge) - main
  thread, allocation-free.

**UNVERIFIED — only the game can tell (PLAYTEST §3 has the steps; the line that settles each)**
1. The engine honours a 0.2 multiplier (no clamp), bows and crossbows included without the
   `Bipedal*` values → `[summary] attack speed check, melee - …` / `swing length` / `ranged` say
   `ARE slower` (x3-x5); `[speed] first exhaustion …` shows the managed values took x0.20.
2. Every swing, mounted too, shows as `ReleaseMelee` on channel 1 → `Athletics detection: …
   during a counted release A, outside one B [in action: …]` with B ≪ A; `(mounted Y)` > 0.
3. Polling ~1000 agents per tick is cheap → `Athletics tick cost: avg … ms`.
4. `OnAgentShootMissile` once per shot → `shots seen N (+E extra projectiles …)` ≈ `ranged
   releases seen by the poll`.
5. Kicks / bashes on channel 1 → `Athletics free: kicks K, shield bashes B, kick/bash hits H`
   (K = 0 with H > 0 = another channel; free either way).
6. Couched lance: `IsDoingPassiveAttack` is true at the landed hit → `couched/braced hits`.
7. Leader flags in campaign, tournaments and custom battle → `[athletics] party leader: …` lines
   and `Athletics heroes: … party leaders (…)`.
8. `GetCurrentActionType(1)` inside `OnMeleeHit` is meaningful → the `[in action: …]` list.
9. Our stat model is on top in every mission type → `[speed] stat model on top in this mission: ours`.
10. The horse's speed drives riders' regen → `Athletics regen: … moving`.
11. `Mission.MainAgent` is set by `OnAgentBuild` (only the "(you)" in the leader list depends on it).

## Step 5b — Athletics rename, defaults.json, master switch (DONE 2026-09-27)

**Built**
- **Rename** (Anton: "it is the Athletics bar that gets depleted"): keys `EnduranceEnabled` →
  `AthleticsEnabled`, `MaxEndurance` → `MaxAthletics`; group "Endurance" → "Athletics"; types and
  files `EnduranceLogic(.Api/.Engine/.Log)` → `AthleticsLogic`, `EnduranceRules/Math/Reading/Stats`
  → `Athletics*`, `FormationEnduranceStats` → `FormationAthleticsStats`, `Endurance.cs` →
  `Athletics.cs`, the tests, smoke `Program.Athletics.cs`; log tag `[athletics]`, buckets
  `athletics-*`, error sites `athletics.*`, summary lines "Athletics …". Words: the bar / pool /
  points = "Athletics"; the character-screen skill = "the Athletics skill". Code renamed by a
  verified script (tag/bucket/site rules, then Endurance → Athletics), docs by hand. No aliases
  for the old keys (nothing released; the loader reports unknown keys as typos).
- **defaults.json** (DESIGN §2c) - the one truth for default values; Core `DefaultsFile`,
  `tools/DefaultsTool`, 21 tests. MCM buttons *Revert all to defaults* / *Save current values
  as a defaults file*; the config header says how to revert without MCM.
- **Master switch `ModEnabled`** (Anton's scope addition mid-step, DESIGN §4): first setting, own
  first group; Core `ModSwitchLog`; 11 tests; a smoke step.
- 154 tests (122 → +21 defaults, +11 master switch), OfflineSmoke 31 checks.

**The one-truth design for defaults**
- `defaults.json` (repo root) → `EmbeddedResource` in Core (LogicalName
  `TraxCombat.Core.defaults.json`; a missing file is a build error on purpose) →
  `DefaultsFile.DefaultFor(key, type, min, max)`, called by the `ParamDef` constructor while
  `SettingsSchema`'s static fields initialise. The schema declares NO default values; everything
  else reads `ParamDef.Default` (new TraxSettings, first-run file, missing key, MCM preset/Reset,
  the revert button, "(default …)" in comments/hints/log).
- **Static-init trap**: the embedded parse runs INSIDE SettingsSchema's type initializer, so it
  must not touch SettingsSchema - it keeps a raw `JToken` per key; unknown-key detection is lazy
  (`DefaultsFile.Problems`, read after the schema exists).
- **Fail safe**: a key missing / unusable in the embedded file → bottom of its range (false for a
  switch); out of range → clamped; all listed in `Problems` → `[config]   defaults.json PROBLEM:`
  lines at load; the smoke fails on any.
- **Tests run on DESIGN's Default column**, not on defaults.json: `DesignTable.cs` has a
  `[ModuleInitializer]` that hands DESIGN's values to `DefaultsFile.UseValuesForTests` before any
  test touches the schema. So Anton tuning defaults.json never breaks a test that counts blows
  (verified: DamageRandomPercent 40 / CostPerBlow 8 / VerboseLogging true → all green, smoke too).
  The smoke runs the real embedded defaults: its config checks read the default and pick
  different hand-edit values; the Athletics smoke sets DESIGN's numbers explicitly.
- DESIGN's Default column = INITIAL value; SchemaTests compare keys + types only.
- `DefaultsFileTests`: keys both ways (exact casing), strict JSON types (true/false; an integer
  token for Int; any number for Float), inside the range, ≤ 4 decimals, the // lines = what
  `DefaultsFile.Write` produces with values blanked (number formatting is free), the embedded
  copy = the repo file, and `ResolveAll` (the load path) finds no problem.
- `dotnet run --project tools/DefaultsTool -- refresh` rewrites comments / headings / order and
  keeps every value; refuses while a key is missing, unknown or bad. `check` reports only.
- **A new setting** = DESIGN row (initial value) + schema entry (no default) + TraxSettings
  property + `"Key": value` anywhere in defaults.json + refresh. Tested workflow (ModEnabled).

**Master switch `ModEnabled`**
- Damage: `DamageRules.ModEnabled`; `Decide` returns `ModOff` LAST (after every other rule), so
  an OFF battle counts exactly the hits an ON battle rolls; `DamageRandomizer` keeps the game's
  value and calls `DamageStats.AddVanilla` → summary "damage while the mod was OFF … avg N per
  hit" (the ON line gained ", avg N per hit"; a mixed battle adds "damage avg per hit: rolled
  (mod ON) … | mod OFF …").
- Athletics: `AthleticsRules.Enabled` = ModEnabled && AthleticsEnabled (+ `OffBecause`), so every
  existing `r.Enabled` gate (poll, hits, shots, regen, read API) covers it; the switch-off path
  (`ApplySettingsChange`) refills everyone and lifts penalties; `SpeedMultiplierFor` checks
  ModEnabled itself (vanilla even before the next tick). Back on = everyone full (Anton's choice,
  kept: a fresh start).
- Mission: `ModSwitchLog` in AthleticsLogic - `[mission] start: … mod ON|OFF`, a `[mission] mod
  switched OFF (ModEnabled) at 42.3 s - …` line per toggle (observed each tick), summary header
  "mod ON" / "mod OFF" / "mod was on for N% of the battle (started ON; OFF at …)". The logic and
  both decorators stay attached while off (logging + the vanilla-keeping tournament AI fix).

**MCM buttons** - verified in MCMv5 **5.12.3** (the Workshop DLL = `..\reference\MCMv5-5.12.3-decompiled`)
and MCM.UI for 1.4.8 (`Bannerlord.MBOptionScreen.v1.4.8.dll`, decompiled for this step):
- `ISettingsPropertyGroupBuilder.AddButton(id, name, IRef, content, Action<ISettingsPropertyButtonBuilder>)`;
  the button builder is an `ISettingsPropertyBuilder<>` (SetOrder / SetRequireRestart / SetHintText).
- Click = `SettingsPropertyVM.OnValueClick`: `if (PropertyReference.Value is Action a) a();` → our
  `ProxyRef<Action>(getter, null)`; getters are instance methods returning a static handler.
- Presets: BuildAsGlobal stores the button's current value (the Action) in the "default" preset;
  applying a preset writes through the setter - null → ignored.
- Page refresh after a revert: every SettingsPropertyVM subscribes to the settings object's
  PropertyChanged and re-reads its value for any name but SAVE_TRIGGERED → `RefreshPage` raises
  "TRAX_VALUES_RESET" via `BaseSettings.OnPropertyChanged`.
- The revert is not in MCM's undo stack (URS): Cancel does not undo it (hint says so). It writes
  config.json itself with EVERY key from memory (`WriteMerged(everyKeyFromMemory)`), so a hand edit
  waiting in the file is overwritten too - "revert all" means all.
- Export: `DefaultsFile.Write(Settings.Snapshot())` → `<config dir>\defaults.json`, the repo file's
  exact layout (copy it over as is; `DefaultsTool check --file <path>` checks it).

**Gotchas**
- Git Bash `sed -i` rewrote a CRLF file as LF - edit defaults.json with the Edit tool or the tool.
- An XML comment cannot contain `--` (MSB4025) - the refresh command lives in C#, not the csproj.
- `[ModuleInitializer]` in a library raises CA2255 - suppressed with a pragma and a reason.
- Check parses with `DuplicatePropertyNameHandling.Error` (strict); the embedded load with
  `Replace` (robust). core.autocrlf=true: the repo stores LF, the build embeds CRLF on Windows;
  the tests compare without line endings.
- ConfigStore: a config.json deleted while the game runs now means "every default" at the next
  re-read (was: the values in effect) - what the header promises.

**UNVERIFIED — only the game can tell (PLAYTEST §4, §5 have the lines)**
1. The two buttons render and click in MCM's real UI (page built by MCM's real builder offline;
   the click path read in the MCM.UI decompile and simulated in the smoke).
2. The page re-reads its values after a revert (the PropertyChanged wiring, same decompile).
3. The green/red InformationManager line shows while the options screen is open.
4. Toggle times: `Mission.CurrentTime` at the first tick after MCM closes.
5. An OFF battle really plays as vanilla, no penalty left over (`[athletics] the whole mod
   (ModEnabled) switched OFF … penalties lifted` + the feel of it).

## Step 5c — Athletics v2 (DONE 2026-09-27)

DESIGN §2 is now the one current spec (§2b folded in; a one-line §2b pointer stays because
TASKS_TODO's 5d line cites it).

**Built** (file map in CLAUDE.md "Layout")
- Settings (38): + `AthleticsPoolFloor` 50, `AthleticsPoolPerSkill` 1.0, `AthleticsPeakPercent` 75,
  `HealthCapsAthletics`, `MinMoveSpeedMultiplier` 0.3, `MountMinSpeedMultiplier` 1.0,
  `DamageBonusFollowsAthletics`, `RegenMultiplierAtFullRun` 0.5, `WalkEffortFraction` 0.4;
  retired `MaxAthletics`, `FullRegenSecondsMoving`, `MovingSpeedThreshold`,
  `ExhaustedRecoverPercent` (schema, TraxSettings, defaults.json + refresh, DESIGN table, MCM by
  construction). Group "Exhaustion" → "Tired fighters"; MCM label "Attack speed when empty (%)".
- Core: `AthleticsMath` v2 (PoolPoints, UsableFraction, PeakShare, Curve → Attack/Run/Mount
  multipliers, DamageUpside, RegenRateMultiplier / IsWalking / Effort, ApplyHealth, PeakBin);
  `DamageRoll.Upside` + `Factor(u, p, upside)`, `RollOutcome.Upside/Spread/Ceiling`;
  `DamageStats` upside bins; `AthleticsStats` rewritten; `BinnedIntervals`, `RunSpeedCheck`;
  `FormationAthleticsStats.MeanPeakShare/InPeak`.
- Module: the engine (skill at spawn, health cap, three multipliers, mount table, recompute
  budget, effort regen, run-speed sampling), `SpeedPenalty.ScaleRun/ScaleMount`, the stat
  decorator's `SpeedFactorsFor`, the damage decorator's attacker f, `TryGetPeakShare`, new log lines.
- Tests 154 → 207; OfflineSmoke 31 → 33 checks. PLAYTEST §3 rewritten; RESEARCH §C/§D addenda.

**Decisions**
- **Fractions and points (the bookkeeping)**: `Fighter.Fraction` = share of the FULL pool; the
  pool is computed LIVE from the cached skill (`max(floor, per-skill × skill)`, never below 1).
  So a pool-setting change keeps shares by construction, and a blow's POINT cost lands as
  cost ÷ pool at that moment (a recruit's 10 = 20% of 50, a legionary's 10 = 7.7% of 130).
  f = min(Fraction ÷ peak%, 1) does not even need the pool. The health cap is a ceiling on the
  same fraction (health left, 0..1), so "the peak line stays on the full pool" holds by
  construction. Lowest/points in the summary = fraction × the pool at the end.
- **The change threshold**: `AthleticsMath.SpeedUpdateStep` = **0.05** per applied multiplier
  (attack, run, horse; step 5 had 0.02 for the cliff) + any move to/from exactly 1 or onto/off
  exactly the floor; a refill that reaches its top sets the speeds exactly. At most
  `MaxRecomputesPerTick` = **50** `UpdateAgentProperties()` a tick (fighters + horses); the rest
  wait a tick (`held a tick by the per-tick budget`). Estimate: a refill from empty to the peak
  ≈ 16 recomputes per fighter; a blow below the peak ≈ 1 (small blows on big pools every 2-3).
- **Walk/run evidence** (RESEARCH §D addendum): human walk limit 1.8 m/s (monsters.xml, the
  formations' own walk gait = min `WalkSpeedCached`); run = native top speed, inferred ≈ 6.2
  (`bipedal_speed_multiplier`) × MaxSpeedMultiplier (0.63-0.79 for typical troops) = 3.9-4.9 m/s
  → walk/top 0.37-0.46, ~0.42. **`WalkEffortFraction` stays 0.4**: above it the rate falls in a
  line, so 0.42 still refills at 98%. The summary's `walk vs run speeds` line measures it.
- **Run lever = `MaxSpeedMultiplier` only**; `CombatMaxSpeedMultiplier` is a ≤ 1 share the base
  clamps (scaling both would square the penalty in combat stance). **Horse lever = `MountSpeed`**
  on the mount's own properties, via a mount table (horse index → rider record, reference-checked
  with `SlowedMount`), so the decorator stays managed-only (offline-safe). `OnAgentMount/Dismount`
  mark the rider; `ApplyMountSpeed` recomputes the old horse (back to 1) and the new one.
- **The skill**: `agent.Character.GetSkillValue(DefaultSkills.Athletics)` at `Track` (heroes via
  `HeroObject`), NOT the stat model's `GetEffectiveSkill` (captain perks etc. would make the bar
  wobble with the formation). Exception or no character → 0 = the floor, counted "(not readable)".
- **Health**: managed `Health ÷ HealthLimit` (limit ≤ 0 → full) at every hit (`OnAgentHit` - after
  the health drop) and every regen step. Healing raises the cap, only regen refills. Athletics
  (or the mod) back on = everyone full, the next regen step cuts to the cap (counted as cuts).
  Health 0 is skipped: `OnAgentHit` fires for the killing blow BEFORE the death, and a whole bar
  "cut" per kill would swamp the summary's biggest cut.
- A slowed rider leaving the field: his horse leaves the mount table at once (the decorator
  reads 1 for it) and is recomputed by the next tick (`ReleaseHorses`, within the budget) -
  never `UpdateAgentProperties` inside `OnAgentRemoved`.
- **Speeds are sampled every regen step** for fighters below their top (not only after the
  delay): the run-speed check needs fighters that are fighting. Effort seconds count only while
  refilling.
- **Damage**: attacker f via `TryGetPeakShare` (f = 1 while Athletics or the mod is off); a mount
  attacker → its `RiderAgent`; no tracked attacker → NaN → the full upside, own "no pool" bin.
  `DamageRules.UpsideFollowsAthletics` (optional last ctor arg) = `DamageBonusFollowsAthletics`.
  Every roll carries its ceiling 1 + p × upside; the summary counts rolls above it (must be 0).
- **Binned attack checks**: an interval is classified by the f bin after the previous release's
  charge (what governs it) vs before the next; a swing length by the bin after its own charge;
  different bins = "mixed", left out. Verdict: the tiredest bin with ≥ 3 samples (empty, else
  below 0.5) vs the peak (≥ 5): ≥ x1.5 slower when ≥ x1.5 asked = ARE slower.
- **Run speed check**: per fighter a fresh top (`GetMaximumForwardUnlimitedSpeed` while his run
  multiplier is 1, refreshed on every such sample); per f bin the mean engine top ÷ fresh, the
  mean asked, speed ÷ fresh (p90 = the 0.05 slice's UPPER edge, max). "follows the curve" =
  |engine − asked| ≤ 0.05 in every bin with ≥ 20 samples and asked < 0.97. Horses alike (the
  mount's fresh top); with MountMin 1.0 the verdict is "unaffected, as asked".
- **First-exhaustion proof**: with the curve the fighter is already slowed before his emptying
  blow, so the "before" snapshot carries the previous multipliers; the check is new ÷ old per
  value; "of his fresh values" = snapshot ÷ previous multipliers (`FirstFresh`).
- Player lines (always, Limited, bucket athletics-player): YOU pool at the first tick, dropped
  below full strength, exhausted, off empty, back at full strength, back to full / to the
  wound's cap, wounded. Verbose buckets: athletics-pool, athletics-health (+ the step-5 ones).
- A consequence of DESIGN's "effort = speed ÷ CURRENT top speed", kept as written: a near-empty
  man's top (x0.3 ≈ 1.3 m/s) is below a formation's walk (1.8 m/s), so keeping up is a flat-out
  run for him - half-rate regen until he has some speed back. DESIGN §2 says so.

**Gotchas**
- Float settings: 0.4f is 0.4000000059… - tests compare curve values to 6 decimals.
- IntervalStats medians are bin CENTRES (x.x25 / x.x75): 2-decimal text is a rounding midpoint,
  formatted differently on .NET 8 and .NET Framework - tests assert around them.
  `RunSpeedCheck` p90 reports the slice's upper edge instead; 0.30 / 0.05 = 5.999… in doubles
  (an epsilon in the binning).
- Offline smoke: fake agents have no Character → skill 0 → the floor (50); health set through
  `_health` and `<HealthLimit>k__BackingField` by IL; the mount table filled by reflection
  (`RegisterMount`). `ApplyMountSpeed`, `RegenPass`, `SampleSpeeds` call native members - not
  reachable offline.
- Git Bash python edits of .cs files keep LF (autocrlf warnings only); markdown only via Edit/Write.

**UNVERIFIED — only the game can tell (PLAYTEST §3; the line that settles each)**
1. The skill read (heroes' real skill, troops' data) → `[athletics] YOU: Athletics skill N → pool …`
   = the character screen; no `(not readable)`; summary `Athletics pools … whose skill could not be read` absent.
2. The engine honours the attack curve at mid values, not only 0.2 → `attack speed check … by f`
   rows with x ≈ asked and `- tired attacks ARE slower`.
3. `MaxSpeedMultiplier` honoured live and `GetMaximumForwardUnlimitedSpeed()` follows it →
   `run speed check, on foot … - the engine's top speed follows the curve`, `moving p90` falling.
4. Horses: `MountSpeed` honoured, the mount table and OnAgentMount/Dismount → with MountMin 0.5
   `[speed] first horse slowed this mission …` and the horses line "follows the curve"; at 1.0
   `unaffected, as asked`.
5. The cap at the hit (`OnAgentHit` after the health drop) → `[athletics] YOU are wounded … capped at …`,
   summary `Athletics health cap: N cuts`.
6. Effort units (MovementVelocity vs top speed) and the walk ratio → `walk vs run speeds … walk/top`
   and `Athletics refill effort … seconds per tenth` (walking near 0.4, running near 1, little above 1).
7. A horse charge reads the rider's f → verbose `[damage] horse charge on … (x…, attacker f …)`.
8. Recompute cost with 1000 agents → `speed updates: N recomputes …, held a tick … M` and
   `Athletics tick cost`.
9. The first-exhaustion check with previous multipliers → `[speed] first exhaustion this mission: …
   - the penalties are in the agent's properties`.

## Step 5d — Tired fighters step back (pointers from 5c)

- f is everywhere: Core `AthleticsMath.PeakShare(in r, st)`, `AthleticsLogic.TryGetPeakShare(agent,
  out f)`, `reading.PeakShare`. Chance = `StepBackMaxChancePercent` × (1 − f) - 0 in the peak zone.
- The natural trigger is the melee release the engine already polls: `StartRelease` (rising edge
  into ReleaseMelee, before/after the charge - use f AFTER the charge, the swing he just paid for)
  or `EndRelease` (the swing's end). AI only (`!agent.IsPlayerControlled`), on foot
  (`MountAgent == null`), melee only (never from `OnAgentShootMissile`).
- The run curve already slows a tired man (x0.3 at 0): a step back is slow when he is empty.
- Dice: Core `IRandomSource` (`ThreadSafeRandom.Shared`, `SeededRandom` for tests).
- Master switch first: ModEnabled / AthleticsEnabled off → no step-back starts, a running one is
  released at once; add it to the smoke's `MasterSwitchIsVanillaLive`. New keys (`StepBack*`):
  DESIGN row + schema + TraxSettings + defaults.json + refresh (see Step 5b).

## Steps 6-9 — the Athletics READ API (from steps 5, 5c)

Static, allocation-free, main thread (call from a view's `OnMissionScreenTick`), in
`Missions/AthleticsLogic.Api.cs`. Every answer is a snapshot struct from Core - never hold our
records.

```csharp
if (AthleticsLogic.TryGetReading(agent, out AthleticsReading r))   // false: a horse (pass RiderAgent),
{                                                                  // untracked, or no mission running
    r.Points; r.Pool; r.Fraction;   // points left (E), his FULL pool (the bar's length), 0..1 (bar fill)
    r.UsablePool; r.UsableFraction; // the health cap: grey the bar from UsableFraction to 1
    r.PeakShare;                    // f = min(E / (peak% × pool), 1): THE colour input (1 = green;
                                    // below the line blue; ≤ BarYellowBelowPercent% of the line yellow…)
    r.PeakFraction; r.InPeakZone;   // where to draw the peak marker (0.75); f ≥ 1
    r.Exhausted;                    // E = 0
    r.SpeedMultiplier; r.RunSpeedMultiplier; r.MountSpeedMultiplier; // applied now (1 = none)
    r.AthleticsSkill; r.IsHero; r.IsLeader;
    r.Enabled;                      // ModEnabled && AthleticsEnabled - off: reads full; the HUD must hide
}
AthleticsLogic.TryGetPeakShare(agent, out double f); // just f (false: not tracked)
if (AthleticsLogic.TryGetFormationStats(formation, out FormationAthleticsStats s)) // player team only
{
    s.Count; s.Exhausted; s.InPeak;  // men, empty, at full strength
    s.MeanPoints; s.StdPoints;       // "72 ± 8" (s.Describe() = "72 ± 8 (40 men, 2 exhausted)")
    s.MeanFraction; s.StdFraction;   // bar fill (shares - pools differ per man since 5c)
    s.MeanPeakShare;                 // the men's average f - colour the squad bar by it
    s.LowFraction(k); s.HighFraction(k); // the ± band, k = FormationSpreadStdDevs, clamped 0..1
}
AthleticsLogic.FormationStatsVersion  // bumps every FormationStatsRefreshSeconds - redraw on change
AthleticsLogic.IsRunning
```
- Formation stats are recomputed by the logic's own tick (one O(N) pass over tracked fighters of
  `Mission.PlayerTeam`, bucketed by `(int)agent.Formation.FormationIndex`), so a view never loops
  agents itself. Enemy formations are not computed (ask if a step needs them).
- Since 5c pools differ per fighter: MeanPoints is an average of different-sized bars (the
  "72 ± 8" text); bars should FILL by MeanFraction and COLOUR by MeanPeakShare (f), the player's
  and target's bars by `r.Fraction` / `r.PeakShare`, with the peak marker at `r.PeakFraction`.
- **Master switch first (step 5b, CLAUDE.md)**: every view / feature checks
  `TraxSettings.Shared.ModEnabled` BEFORE anything else, live, and hides / undoes what it shows
  when it is off (5d: no step-back starts, a running one is released to the formation at once;
  6-9: every bar and panel hidden); add that "off" behaviour to the smoke's
  `MasterSwitchIsVanillaLive` step.
- **New parameters** (5d's `StepBack*`, 6's bar colours, 8's `ShowFormationHealth`):
  DESIGN Parameters row (initial value) + schema entry (NO default) + TraxSettings property +
  `"Key": value` in defaults.json + `dotnet run --project tools/DefaultsTool -- refresh`; move the
  row out of DESIGN's "Planned parameters". Retiring one = remove it from all of those (done that
  way in 5c for four keys); the tests name whatever is left. `AthleticsRules` takes `modEnabled`
  as an optional last ctor argument (`From` passes it); `DamageRules` takes `modEnabled`, then
  `upsideFollowsAthletics`.
- The HUD can be added from `AthleticsLogic`'s first tick (`MissionScreen.AddMissionView`) - the
  first-tick branch is in `AthleticsLogic.OnMissionTick`.

## Step 6 — Player bar

- Read: `AthleticsLogic.TryGetReading(Agent.Main, out var r)` every `HudRefreshSeconds`. Since 5c:
  number = `r.Points` / `r.Pool`, fill `r.Fraction`, peak marker at `r.PeakFraction`, colour from
  `r.PeakShare` (f ≥ 1 green, below the line blue, then the Bar*BelowPercent thresholds on f),
  the wounded part (from `r.UsableFraction` to 1) greyed.
- `PlayerAthleticsView : MissionBattleUIBaseView` + own `GauntletLayer` + VM + prefab in
  `module\GUI\Prefabs`. Added by `AthleticsLogic`'s first tick via
  `MissionScreen.AddMissionView` (NOT in OnMissionBehaviorInitialize — §F/§G).
- Layer created/destroyed in `OnMissionScreenTick` on `ModEnabled && ShowPlayerBar &&
  !HideBattleUI && combat mode` (hot swap; the master switch first - step 5b). Place beside the vanilla hero bar (bottom-right, MarginBottom 90 /
  MarginRight 40 in `AgentStatus.xml`); RBM's bars are the style reference (§G).
- (from step 3) The Module already references `TaleWorlds.MountAndBlade.View`, `GauntletUI`,
  `GauntletUI.Data`, `Engine.GauntletUI`, `ScreenSystem`, `InputSystem`; `deploy.ps1` copies
  `module\GUI` into the dev module (folder does not exist yet — create `module\GUI\Prefabs`).

## Step 7 — Looked-at NPC bar

- `TargetAthleticsView`, same pattern. Own raycast `Mission.RayCastForClosestAgent` from
  `MissionScreen.CombatCamera` every `HudRefreshSeconds`, mount → `RiderAgent`, linger.
  Needs the proposed `TargetBarMaxDistance` / `TargetBarLingerSeconds` (implication 7).
- Read: `AthleticsLogic.TryGetReading(target.IsMount ? target.RiderAgent : target, out var r)`.
- Hidden while `ModEnabled` is off (the master switch first - step 5b).

## Step 8 — Squad bars above formations

- `FormationAthleticsView`: player formations = `PlayerTeam.FormationsIncludingEmpty`,
  `CountOfUnits > 0`, `PlayerOrderController.IsFormationSelectable`. Mean/std: already computed
  by step 5 - `AthleticsLogic.TryGetFormationStats(formation, out var f)`, redraw when
  `FormationStatsVersion` moves (band = `f.LowFraction(FormationSpreadStdDevs)` ..
  `f.HighFraction(…)`). Average HEALTH (DESIGN §3 additions) is not computed yet - add it to the
  same refresh pass (`RefreshFormationStats`) rather than a second loop. Position = `MBWindowManager.WorldToScreen(CombatCamera,
  CachedMedianPosition.GetGroundVec3() + (0,0,FormationBarHeight))`, hide when w < 0.
  Anchor via bound `ScaledPosition*Offset` or an own `Widget` subclass (§G, UNVERIFIED #7).
  Implication 8 (`FormationBarsAlways`). Hidden while `ModEnabled` is off (step 5b).

## Step 9 — Orders menu

- Vanilla cards are generated code — cannot be extended without UIExtenderEx (§G).
  Default plan (implication 1): our own compact per-formation panel while
  `Mission.IsOrderMenuOpen`, inside `FormationAthleticsView`. UIExtenderEx satellite only
  if Anton insists on numbers inside the cards (and then test with RTS Camera).
- Numbers: `AthleticsLogic.TryGetFormationStats(formation, out var f)` → `f.Describe()`-style
  "72 ± 8" (use `f.MeanPoints` / `f.StdPoints` directly for the strip).
- Hidden while `ModEnabled` is off (step 5b).

## Step 10 — Balance + polish

## Step 11 — Steam packaging
