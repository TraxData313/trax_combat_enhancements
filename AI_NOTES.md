# AI notes

Claude's detail companion to TASKS_TODO.md — one section per BUILD ORDER step. Read the
step's section before starting it; leave it richer than you found it.

---

## Step 2 — Research (no code)

Goal: every hook the mod needs, verified against the **v1.4.8** decompiled game
(`..\reference\game-decompiled\`, decompile more assemblies beside it when needed), written
to `docs/RESEARCH.md` — per question: the verified answer with source file references, the
recommended approach, the risks. If something in DESIGN.md turns out infeasible or costly,
say so there and propose the nearest good alternative.

Questions:

- **A. Damage** — where is a landed hit's FINAL damage (after armor) computed, for people
  and horses, melee and missiles? Is it a game model (AgentApplyDamageModel?) registered in
  BOTH the campaign and custom battle, and can we DECORATE it (does v1.4.8 hand us the
  previously registered model)? If not, the cleanest Harmony point.
- **B. Detecting a blow** — the cheapest reliable signal that a fighter RELEASED an attack,
  landed or not: melee swing/thrust, bow, crossbow, throw — for AI and player alike, with
  1000 agents. And the signal for a LANDED blow (incl. one that hit a shield / was parried).
- **C. Slowing attacks** — which AgentDrivenProperties govern melee swing, thrust, bow draw,
  crossbow reload, throw speed; where they are computed (AgentStatCalculateModel?); how to
  apply a temporary ×0.2 to ONE agent and remove it again, surviving the game's own
  recomputes (weapon switch, etc.). Does the engine clamp the multiplier?
- **D. Movement** — agent speed on foot and on horseback for the standing/moving regen rule.
- **E. Hero / party leader** — from an Agent: is it a hero, and is it the leader of its own
  party (campaign: agent origin → party → LeaderHero). What to do in custom battle.
- **F. Mission lifecycle** — adding our MissionBehavior to every combat mission (field,
  siege, hideout, arena/tournament, custom battle); agent spawn/remove events; cheapest
  per-agent state storage.
- **G. HUD** — how vanilla shows the player's health (VM + prefab) and how we add our own
  bar near it (own GauntletLayer in a MissionView? no UIExtenderEx if avoidable); world →
  screen projection for bars floating above formations; which agent the player is
  looking/aiming at; the orders-menu formation cards (VM + prefab) and whether adding to
  them needs UIExtenderEx (+ Harmony/ButterLib) — cost of that dependency vs alternatives.
  Is RCM in the Workshop folder? Where/how its posture bar sits (style reference only).
- **H. Config + MCM** — MCM v5's fluent builder (verify the API against the MCM DLLs in
  Workshop item 2859238197) used from method bodies only, so the mod loads WITHOUT MCM;
  compare with the sibling bridges (`..\ImmersiveAI`, `..\TrainingBattlesMod\...\Mcm`).
  Config file format: is Newtonsoft.Json shipped with the game, and can it read a JSON file
  with `//` comments (the instructions beside each value)?
- **I. Harmony** — is it needed at all after A–H? Prefer not.

Answered in `docs/RESEARCH.md` (A–I, plus J hot swap and K logging, added mid-step at
Anton's request). Verdict: no Harmony, no UIExtenderEx; 13 design implications for Anton at
the top of RESEARCH.

## Step 3 — Scaffold (DONE 2026-09-27)

**Built** (file map in CLAUDE.md "Layout"): solution + `Directory.Build.props` (`*.user`
import); Core (schema of all 32 DESIGN settings, `TraxSettings.Shared`, config-file text,
merge rule, edit tracker, rate limiter) + 53 xUnit tests; Module `TraxCombatEnhancements.dll`
(SubModule, ModPaths, ConfigStore, TraxLog, McmBridge, two pass-through decorators,
AthleticsLogic stub); `module/SubModule.xml` v0.1.0; `tools/deploy.ps1` (build → AssemblyGuard
→ OfflineSmoke → install as `Modules\TraxCombatEnhancements.Dev`); `tools/AssemblyGuard`;
`tools/OfflineSmoke` (16 checks, see below). PLAYTEST §1 written.

**How later steps use it**
- Read settings AT USE TIME: `TraxSettings.Shared.DamageRandomPercent` etc. (typed property per
  key). Never copy into a field at mission start. To rebuild on change: subscribe
  `TraxSettings.Shared.Changed` (raised on the setter's thread, main thread in practice) or
  compare `TraxSettings.Shared.Version`.
- A NEW setting = a row in DESIGN's table + an entry in `SettingsSchema` (right group, right
  place — file and MCM order follow it) + a typed property on `TraxSettings`. `SchemaTests`
  fail until all three agree; the file and the MCM page pick it up by themselves; an old
  config.json gets the new key written in at the next read (logged).
- Log: `TraxLog.Info(tag, msg)`; chatty lines `if (TraxLog.VerboseOn) TraxLog.Verbose(tag, msg)`
  (check VerboseOn FIRST so the hot path builds no strings); `TraxLog.Error("area.hook", e)` in
  every catch. Tags in TraxLog's class doc.
- Summary: `AthleticsLogic.WriteSummary` has the marked spot for step 4/5 lines.
- Offline checks: add to `tools/OfflineSmoke/Program.cs` whatever can run without the game
  (it already loads the game's DLLs on .NET Framework; pure managed game types can be
  constructed, e.g. `new TraxAgentStatModel(...)`).

**Decisions**
- **THE FILE-REWRITE RULE** (`Core/ConfigMerge.cs`, tested + smoke): when the mod writes
  config.json while one exists (MCM Done; adding missing keys), it RE-READS the disk file at
  that moment; per setting — changed in MCM since the last write → memory's value; else a
  valid value on disk → the disk's value (a hand edit made while the game runs survives, and
  applies at the next battle start); else memory. Unknown keys carried in a trailing "Not
  recognised" section. "Changed in MCM" = live value differs from the value before the first
  MCM edit (`EditTracker`), so a slider moved and moved back, or MCM's Cancel, never overwrites
  a hand edit. A disk file that does not parse → copied to `config.json.broken-<time>`, then
  written fresh from memory. At a read, the file is rewritten only when keys are MISSING and
  nothing is invalid (an invalid hand value is left for the player to see in the log). Own
  `//` comments are not preserved (the header says so). Writes via temp file + replace.
- **Reads**: startup, every game start/load (`OnGameStart`), every mission start
  (`OnMissionBehaviorInitialize`, before AthleticsLogic attaches). Missing/invalid key →
  default. Before a re-read, MCM edits that never reached the disk are written first.
- **MCM "default" preset kept and filled with DESIGN's defaults** (RESEARCH §H said remove
  it — wrong: MCM.UI's page Reset and per-setting reset apply the preset with id "default";
  without it Reset silently does nothing). `CreatePreset("default", …)` BEFORE `BuildAsGlobal`
  wins because MCM's preset builder keeps the first value per key. Verified offline.
- **No lambdas with MCM-typed parameters** (they compile to a cached static field typed on MCM
  → the load trap; RESEARCH §H's sample would have failed the guard — proven with a probe
  DLL). Builder callbacks are instance methods `Fill(object)` passed as `Action<object>`
  (contravariance). The built settings are held as `object`. Guard: 0 errors, 0 warnings.
- Float settings stored rounded to 4 decimals (MCM's 0.1f → 0.1); ints rounded; all as
  doubles in one array. Ranges chosen per setting (see `SettingsSchema`), e.g.
  `ExhaustedAttackSpeedPercent` 5–100 (0 could freeze an animation), `ExhaustedRecoverPercent`
  0–90, `MaxAthletics` 10–1000. Every setting is `ApplyTiming.Live` (a test enforces it; a
  NextBattle one must be a deliberate exception).
- `ConfigVersion: 1` stamp in the file (meta, not a setting) — bump + migrate if a later step
  must change the meaning or push a new default into existing files (every key is written, so
  a changed default does NOT reach an existing file otherwise).
- Error handling: every game hook try/catch → `[error]` with stack, rate-limited per place
  (3 stacks, then one per 10 s, counts reported); a red in-game line at most every 30 s
  (queued, shown from `OnApplicationTick` = main thread). Verbose: 40-line burst, 20/s per tag.
- RBM (manager commit f7dc70c, DESIGN §5): `[compat]` line at every load; if module id `RBM` or
  `RBM_*` is enabled, ONE yellow message per session (main menu, else game start).
- Deploy ships the `.pdb` files (line numbers in `[error]` stacks), never Newtonsoft.Json (the
  game's own 13.0.0.0 is used; Core compiles against the 13.0.1 package — same identity).

**Gotchas**
- `TaleWorlds.Engine.Path` clashes with `System.IO.Path` — alias it (`using Path = System.IO.Path;`).
- MCM needs `0Harmony` at run time (its wrappers use HarmonyLib extensions) — in game the
  Bannerlord.Harmony module provides it; the offline smoke resolves it from Workshop 2859188632.
- MCM's `ISettingsPropertyGroupBuilder` keys properties by DISPLAY NAME: labels must be unique
  within a group (tested). Group names must not contain `/` (sub-group delimiter; tested).
- `ProxyRef<T>` silently ignores a value of the wrong CLR type (`value is T`): bool/int/float
  exactly — the preset boxes each default as its setting's type.
- The informational version carries `+<git commit>` of HEAD at build time (SDK SourceLink):
  the `[load]` line says which build Anton runs — deploy AFTER the final commit.
- Windows PowerShell 5.1 runs `deploy.ps1`: keep it ASCII; manifest read/written with explicit UTF-8.

**UNVERIFIED — only the game can tell (PLAYTEST §1 has the lines that prove each)**
1. The mod loads in the launcher/game, with MCM and without (GetTypes() without MCM passes
   offline on .NET Framework with the real game DLLs; the real module loader is not run).
2. `EngineFilePaths.ConfigsPath` resolves to `Documents\Mount and Blade II Bannerlord\Configs`
   in game (fallback path logged if not).
3. MCM registration timing: `BaseSettingsBuilder.Create` non-null at the main menu or within
   the 1 s retries; the page appears in Mod Options with 7 groups / 32 settings (built and
   inspected offline through MCM's real builder + discoverer, but not the Gauntlet UI).
4. MCM opened from the Escape menu MID-BATTLE edits live values; Done raises SAVE_TRIGGERED
   in game (the container path is decompiled, not run); slider drags log every step.
5. The two decorators register over the expected base models in campaign, custom battle and
   War Sails games, and vanilla combat is unchanged (pass-through).
6. The tournament AI-level fix in a real tournament (mechanics verified offline).
7. `OnEndMissionInternal` → `[summary]` for every ending (victory, defeat, retreat, leaving a
   town scene); `Mission.CombatType` / `Mode` values at AfterStart.
8. `Utilities.GetModulesNames()` at OnSubModuleLoad (module list + RBM detection).
9. `InformationManager.DisplayMessage` at the main menu (load line, RBM line, error line).

## Step 4 — Damage randomness (DONE 2026-09-27)

**Built** (file map in CLAUDE.md "Layout"): Core `RandomSource.cs` (IRandomSource,
ThreadSafeRandom, SeededRandom), `DamageRoll.cs` (HitFacts, DamageRules, Decide, Factor,
Apply, Roll, GameRound), `DamageStats.cs` (per-mission stats + summary text) + 39 tests (92
total, incl. a 200k-roll distribution check: bounds, mean, flat histogram). Module
`Models/DamageRandomizer.cs` + `TraxDamageModel.ApplyGeneralDamageModifiers` (the only
non-forwarding member); `AthleticsLogic.AfterStart` → `DamageRandomizer.OnMissionStart()`,
`WriteSummary` → `DamageRandomizer.WriteSummary()` (own try). `TraxLog.Verbose(tag, msg,
bucket)` overload. OfflineSmoke +6 checks (22) in `Program.Damage.cs`. PLAYTEST §2.

**The flow per hit** (main thread): `BaseModel.ApplyGeneralDamageModifiers` (outside our try —
its exceptions are the game's own) → `HitFacts` from `cd.IsColliderAgent`,
`ai.IsVictimAgentNull`, `cd.IsFallDamage`, `cd.AttackBlockedWithShield`, `cd.IsMissile`,
`ai.IsVictimAgentMount`, `cd.IsHorseCharge` → `DamageRules.From(TraxSettings.Shared)` (live) →
`Decide` → skip (counted, verbose line in bucket `damage-skip`) or `Roll` (counted, first roll
per mission always logged with its thread, verbose line otherwise) → the game rounds our value.

**Decisions**
- **Skip order** (first match wins, each counted by reason): object (not an agent collider) →
  no victim → fall → the game's value rounds to 0 → master switch → spread 0 → shield toggle →
  mount toggle → melee/ranged toggle. Target toggles (shield, mount) and attack toggles
  (melee/ranged) COMBINE: an arrow into a horse rolls only with Ranged AND OnMounts on.
- **Category** for the stats is exclusive: shield → mount → ranged → melee. Horse charge =
  melee (follows `DamageRandomMelee`). Kicks/bashes (`IsAlternativeAttack`) = melee, rolled.
  Missile area damage and siege-engine shots at people = ranged (they are `IsMissile`).
  Friendly fire rolls too (a landed strike); its verbose line says "friendly fire".
- **Rounding rule, precisely**: the game does `(int)Math.Round(x)` (banker's: 0.5 → 0, 2.5 → 2).
  "0 stays 0" = if the game's value would SHOW as 0 (x ≤ 0.5) we return it untouched; else
  `max(1, x·f)`. Factor = 1 − p + 2p·u with u ∈ [0,1) → [1 − p, 1 + p); the top is never quite
  reached (fine). p = 100 can draw ~0 → floor 1.
- **Errors**: our part throws → the game's value; `DamageStats.AddError(site)` is true only the
  first time per site per mission → that one goes to `TraxLog.Error` (stack + red in-game line),
  the rest are counted in the summary ("damage roll errors: N (damage.roll N)"). Sites:
  `damage.roll` (the hook), `damage.log` (building a log line — the roll still stands),
  `damage.mission-start`, `damage.summary`.
- **Thread**: verified from source — every hit callback is `[MBCallback(null, false)]`
  (not multi-thread callable) → main thread (RESEARCH §A updated). Still: dice per thread,
  stats under one uncontended lock, and every roll compares its thread with the one
  `OnMissionStart` ran on → summary "ran on the main thread: all N" or "OFF the main thread".
- **No new parameters.** The histogram's 10 slices and the verbose bucket name are log
  plumbing, not gameplay numbers.
- Implications 2–4 of RESEARCH (knockdown follows the roll; shields not rolled by default;
  charge = melee, fall/objects never) are already in DESIGN §1 and Interpretation 9; the code
  follows them. DESIGN unchanged in this step.

**Gotchas**
- `AttackCollisionData` has private fields; offline it is built with the game's public
  `AttackCollisionData.GetAttackCollisionDataForDebugPurpose(...)` (IsHorseCharge =
  ChargeVelocity > 0, IsFallDamage = FallSpeed > 0). `AttackInformation` has public fields —
  `new AttackInformation { IsVictimAgentNull = …, IsVictimAgentMount = … }` works offline.
  `CustomAgentApplyDamageModel.ApplyGeneralDamageModifiers` returns its input → a clean base
  for offline checks (`model.Initialize(base)` sets BaseModel).
- The verbose limiter is keyed by bucket: a flood in one bucket (the smoke's flood check)
  empties it for ~2 s — the smoke sleeps 1 s before its verbose checks.
- The game's combat log already shows "Extra damage from skills, perks and effects: N" /
  "Reduced damage…" whenever `CalculateDamage` changes the value (`combatLog.ModifiedDamage`) —
  our roll shows up there, mixed with perks.
- `Agent.Name` allocates (TextObject.ToString) — only in the verbose/first-roll path.

**UNVERIFIED — only the game can tell (PLAYTEST §2 has the lines)**
1. The engine calls our `ApplyGeneralDamageModifiers` for every landed hit in campaign,
   custom battle and naval battles (`[damage] first roll this mission` line).
2. Hit callbacks on the main thread (source says so; the first-roll line proves it).
3. Shield HP: the native `Agent.OnShieldDamaged(slot, inflictedDamage)` uses the collision's
   (rolled) InflictedDamage — only matters with `DamageRandomOnShields` on.
4. Object hits (gates, siege engines) really reach the model as `!IsColliderAgent` (counted as
   "objects") — source says `GetAttackCollisionResults` runs for them with damage > 0.
5. Names in the verbose line for the player, mounts (`horse X of Y`) and missiles (the missile
   item) read well in game.
6. Combined with other damage mods (only RBM is declared incompatible): the summary's before →
   after is the tool.

## Step 5 — Endurance core (DONE 2026-09-27; renamed Athletics in step 5b - names below are the new ones)

**Built** (file map in CLAUDE.md "Layout"): Core `Athletics.cs` (AthleticsRules, Fighter,
AthleticsMath), `SpreadStats.cs` (MeanStd, FormationAthleticsStats, IntervalStats,
SpeedVerdict), `AthleticsStats.cs` (per-mission counters + summary text) + 30 tests (122).
Module: `AthleticsLogic` as 4 partial files (lifecycle / Engine / Api / Log), `TrackedAgent`,
`Models/SpeedPenalty.cs`, `TraxAgentStatModel.UpdateAgentStats` (the one non-forwarding
change), `TraxLog.Limited`. OfflineSmoke +6 checks (28) in `Program.Athletics.cs`. PLAYTEST §3.

**The flow** (all main thread):
- Spawn: `OnAgentBuild` → `Track` (humans only; mounts never) → hero / leader flags cached.
  First tick: `SweepAgents` picks up anyone spawned before us.
- Tick (`TickAthletics`): settings version changed → `ApplySettingsChange`; for every tracked
  active fighter one native `GetCurrentActionType(1)` → on a change `ObserveAction` (rising edge
  into ReleaseMelee = `StartRelease` → `Charge`; falling edge = swing length; ReleaseRanged /
  ReleaseThrowing / Kick / WeaponBash only counted); `SpeedDirty` → `UpdateAgentProperties()`;
  every 0.1 s `RegenPass`; every `FormationStatsRefreshSeconds` `RefreshFormationStats`.
- Events: `OnMeleeHit` (couched/braced charge, the release check, landed-only melee),
  `OnAgentShootMissile` (ranged charge, 0.1 s dedupe, remembers the missile index),
  `OnMissileHit` (landed-only ranged).
- `Charge` → Core `AthleticsMath.Charge` → stats → `RetargetSpeed` (new multiplier? mark
  dirty) → `OnExhausted`. Regen → `OnRecovered` (retarget) / `OnRefilled`.
- Decorator: `BaseModel.UpdateAgentStats` → `AthleticsLogic.SpeedMultiplierFor(agent)` (1 for
  untracked / no mission / AthleticsEnabled off) → `SpeedPenalty.Scale`.

**Decisions**
- **State = FRACTION of the pool** (`Fighter.Fraction`, 1 = full): "MaxAthletics change keeps
  each fighter's fraction" holds by construction; points = fraction × `PoolPoints`.
- **One pure function per rule** (manager's heads-up for Athletics v2, DESIGN §2b):
  `AthleticsMath.PoolPoints(r, f)`, `BlowCostPoints`, `RegenFractionPerSecond(r, f, speed,
  topSpeed)` (top speed already passed, unused by §2), `AttackSpeedMultiplier` (a float per
  fighter), `IsExhausted`. 5c changes those bodies, not the plumbing.
- **Speed = a float per fighter** (`Fighter.SpeedMultiplier`) that the decorator applies on
  EVERY recompute. The logic re-targets it on a charge, a recovery or a setting change and asks
  for `UpdateAgentProperties()` only when it moved by `SpeedUpdateStep` (0.02) or to/from 1 —
  §2's cliff flips twice per exhaustion; 5c's line will move in small steps.
- **`UpdateAgentProperties()` only from the tick**, never inside an engine hit callback (not
  proven unsafe - just not risked): ≤ 1 frame late.
- **Poll every tick, not throttled**: release phases of fast weapons can be short; the cost is
  measured (`Athletics tick cost`). Fallback if it shows: `AgentComponent.OnTickParallel`.
- **Regen every 0.1 s**, only fighters below full or exhausted (a full fighter costs nothing, no
  native call). The integration is exact (only the part of the step after the delay counts); the
  moving sample and recovery are 0.1 s coarse. Moving = `(MountAgent ?? agent).MovementVelocity`.
- **Recovery is checked every regen step** even without a gain, so a lowered
  `ExhaustedRecoverPercent` applies at once.
- **Hit before the poll saw the release**: `OnMeleeHit` reads the action itself and runs the same
  `ObserveAction`. A hit counts "in a counted release" if we were in one until now (the engine may
  already be in the blocked/parried reaction) or the action is a release now.
- **Landed-only melee** (`CostOnMiss` off): first hit on an agent per swing, keyed on the swing
  counter (`ReleaseSerial` vs `LandedSerial`); a hit outside any release charges at most once per
  `BlowTimeSeconds` (counted as "time fallback"). A release charged in on-miss mode marks its
  serial, so switching modes mid-swing never charges twice.
- **Landed-only ranged**: the shooter's own last 4 missile indices (`MissilesList`'s last entry at
  `OnAgentShootMissile` - the game adds it right before calling behaviours); siege-engine
  missiles never get there; a multi-penetration missile charges once.
- **Couched lance / braced spear**: `IsDoingPassiveAttack` in `OnMeleeHit`, victim ≠ null, at
  most one per `BlowTimeSeconds` (a couch through two men = one blow). Horse-charge bumps
  (`IsHorseCharge`) and kicks / bashes (`IsAlternativeAttack`) are free.
- **AthleticsEnabled off mid-battle**: `ResetFull()` everyone + retarget (penalties lifted on the
  next tick); the decorator ALSO checks the flag live (fail safe). On again: everyone full.
- **Leaders**: campaign = `(Origin.BattleCombatant as PartyBase).LeaderHero.CharacterObject ==
  agent.Character`; no campaign = `BattleCombatant.General == agent.Character`, a side without a
  general → its heroes. A leader who is not a hero (defensive) gets the leader factor alone.
- "Athletics spent" = points really drained (a swing at 0 drains nothing).
- **The attack-speed measurement** (the engine-clamp question): melee time between releases,
  ranged time between shots, and the length of swings that hit NOTHING (purest - a hit cuts the
  animation short); each classified by the penalty at both ends (a change in between → left out);
  0.05 s histogram up to 30 s; verdict "ARE slower" at ≥ x1.5 the fresh median.
- Always-on lines: the player's own exhaustion / recovery / back-to-full and each party leader
  at spawn (`TraxLog.Limited`, own buckets); everyone else's in verbose buckets
  (athletics-blow, -exhaust, -regen, -hero, speed-update).
- **No new parameters.** 0.1 s regen step, 0.1 s shot dedupe, 0.02 speed step, 30 s interval
  cap, x1.5 verdict are engine/log plumbing. DESIGN unchanged.

**Gotchas**
- **Agent's static initializer calls the engine** (`DefaultTauntActions` → `ActionIndexCache` →
  `MBAnimation`). Offline: never touch an Agent STATIC field; `FieldInfo.SetValue` on an Agent
  INSTANCE runs the type initializer too (and breaks the type for the process) - the smoke sets
  backing fields with IL `stfld` (`FieldSetter`). `FormatterServices.GetUninitializedObject`
  is fine.
- **`Agent.IsActive()` and `GetMaximumForwardUnlimitedSpeed()` are raw pointer reads**
  (`AgentHelper`): on an uninitialized agent = access violation (uncatchable crash). Offline
  paths avoid them (`WriteAthleticsSummary` samples speeds only with a Mission).
- `ActionCodeType`, `FormationClass` and `DrivenProperty` have ALIAS values - `ToString()` may
  print `AttackMeleeAllBegin` / `NumberOfDefaultFormations`. Names come from a fixed table
  (formations: "1 Infantry"… as the game numbers them) or the first declared field.
- Sandbox's and CustomBattle's `UpdateHumanStats` assign the three speed values with `=` on
  every recompute → scaling after the base never compounds. A base model that multiplied instead
  would compound - the first-exhaustion log would show a ratio ≠ the asked one.
- There is NO native getter for driven properties: "the penalty is in the agent's properties"
  proves the managed side (what we send); only the timing check proves the engine uses it.
- .NET Framework (the game, the smoke) formats midpoints differently from .NET 8 (the tests):
  the smoke asserts text prefixes around such numbers.

**For step 5c** (manager asked; verified in source, values UNVERIFIED in game)
- Top speed: `agent.GetMaximumForwardUnlimitedSpeed()` - pointer read, cheap; for a rider use
  the mount's. Speed: `(MountAgent ?? agent).MovementVelocity.Length` (native, m/s).
- Walk speed: `agent.WalkSpeedCached` (managed) = the mount's `WalkingSpeedLimitOfMountable`
  (native) or `Monster.WalkingSpeedLimit` - `Modules\Native\ModuleData\monsters.xml`: human
  1.8 m/s (human_settlement 1.4, child 1.6). The summary's `speeds for step 5c` line measures
  walk vs top on foot and for horses every mission, plus a histogram of speed ÷ top speed seen
  while refilling (tenths, "above 1" = faster than the "top"). That gives `WalkEffortFraction`.
- Run-speed lever: driven properties `MaxSpeedMultiplier` (87) / `CombatMaxSpeedMultiplier` (88)
  in the same decorator (same pattern as the attack speed). `Agent.SetMaximumSpeedLimit` is the
  formation movement's own lever - avoid it.
- Per-fighter pool (Athletics, DESIGN §2b as revised in 11edf4f): cache the skill on the record at
  `Track` (e.g. `GetEffectiveSkill(agent, DefaultSkills.Athletics)` through the stat model) and
  make `AthleticsMath.PoolPoints(r, f)` read it; the fraction store already keeps each share when
  the pool changes. Health cap: clamp `Fraction` to health left in the regen step and on a hit.
- Damage upside from the ATTACKER's Athletics: the damage decorator can call
  `AthleticsLogic.TryGetReading(attacker, out var r)` (the rider for a horse charge) - main
  thread, allocation-free.

**UNVERIFIED — only the game can tell (PLAYTEST §3 has the steps; the line that settles each)**
1. The engine honours a 0.2 multiplier (no clamp), bows and crossbows included without the
   `Bipedal*` values → `[summary] attack speed check, melee - …` / `swing length` / `ranged` say
   `ARE slower` (x3-x5); `[speed] first exhaustion …` shows the managed values took x0.20.
2. Every swing, mounted too, shows as `ReleaseMelee` on channel 1 → `Athletics detection: …
   during a counted release A, outside one B [in action: …]` with B ≪ A; `(mounted Y)` > 0.
3. Polling ~1000 agents per tick is cheap → `Athletics tick cost: avg … ms`.
4. `OnAgentShootMissile` once per shot → `shots seen N (+E extra projectiles …)` ≈ `ranged
   releases seen by the poll`.
5. Kicks / bashes on channel 1 → `Athletics free: kicks K, shield bashes B, kick/bash hits H`
   (K = 0 with H > 0 = another channel; free either way).
6. Couched lance: `IsDoingPassiveAttack` is true at the landed hit → `couched/braced hits`.
7. Leader flags in campaign, tournaments and custom battle → `[athletics] party leader: …` lines
   and `Athletics heroes: … party leaders (…)`.
8. `GetCurrentActionType(1)` inside `OnMeleeHit` is meaningful → the `[in action: …]` list.
9. Our stat model is on top in every mission type → `[speed] stat model on top in this mission: ours`.
10. The horse's speed drives riders' regen → `Athletics regen: … moving`.
11. `Mission.MainAgent` is set by `OnAgentBuild` (only the "(you)" in the leader list depends on it).

## Steps 6-9 — the Athletics READ API (from step 5)

Static, allocation-free, main thread (call from a view's `OnMissionScreenTick`), in
`Missions/AthleticsLogic.Api.cs`. Every answer is a snapshot struct from Core - never hold our
records.

```csharp
if (AthleticsLogic.TryGetReading(agent, out AthleticsReading r))   // false: a horse (pass RiderAgent),
{                                                                  // untracked, or no mission running
    r.Points; r.Pool; r.Fraction;   // points left, the fighter's pool, 0..1 (bar fill)
    r.Exhausted; r.SpeedMultiplier; // exhausted now; the attack-speed factor applied (1 = none)
    r.IsHero; r.IsLeader;
    r.Enabled;                      // AthleticsEnabled - off: reads full; the HUD should hide
}
if (AthleticsLogic.TryGetFormationStats(formation, out FormationAthleticsStats f)) // player team only
{
    f.Count; f.Exhausted;
    f.MeanPoints; f.StdPoints;       // "72 ± 8" (f.Describe() = "72 ± 8 (40 men, 2 exhausted)")
    f.MeanFraction; f.StdFraction;   // bar fill
    f.LowFraction(k); f.HighFraction(k); // the ± band, k = FormationSpreadStdDevs, clamped 0..1
}
AthleticsLogic.FormationStatsVersion  // bumps every FormationStatsRefreshSeconds - redraw on change
AthleticsLogic.IsRunning
```
- Formation stats are recomputed by the logic's own tick (one O(N) pass over tracked fighters of
  `Mission.PlayerTeam`, bucketed by `(int)agent.Formation.FormationIndex`), so a view never loops
  agents itself. Enemy formations are not computed (ask if a step needs them).
- Athletics v2 (5c) keeps this API; readings stay in points + fraction (pools become per fighter).
- The HUD can be added from `AthleticsLogic`'s first tick (`MissionScreen.AddMissionView`) - the
  first-tick branch is in `AthleticsLogic.OnMissionTick`.

## Step 6 — Player bar

- Read: `AthleticsLogic.TryGetReading(Agent.Main, out var r)` every `HudRefreshSeconds`.
- `PlayerAthleticsView : MissionBattleUIBaseView` + own `GauntletLayer` + VM + prefab in
  `module\GUI\Prefabs`. Added by `AthleticsLogic`'s first tick via
  `MissionScreen.AddMissionView` (NOT in OnMissionBehaviorInitialize — §F/§G).
- Layer created/destroyed in `OnMissionScreenTick` on `ShowPlayerBar && !HideBattleUI &&
  combat mode` (hot swap). Place beside the vanilla hero bar (bottom-right, MarginBottom 90 /
  MarginRight 40 in `AgentStatus.xml`); RBM's bars are the style reference (§G).
- (from step 3) The Module already references `TaleWorlds.MountAndBlade.View`, `GauntletUI`,
  `GauntletUI.Data`, `Engine.GauntletUI`, `ScreenSystem`, `InputSystem`; `deploy.ps1` copies
  `module\GUI` into the dev module (folder does not exist yet — create `module\GUI\Prefabs`).

## Step 7 — Looked-at NPC bar

- `TargetAthleticsView`, same pattern. Own raycast `Mission.RayCastForClosestAgent` from
  `MissionScreen.CombatCamera` every `HudRefreshSeconds`, mount → `RiderAgent`, linger.
  Needs the proposed `TargetBarMaxDistance` / `TargetBarLingerSeconds` (implication 7).
- Read: `AthleticsLogic.TryGetReading(target.IsMount ? target.RiderAgent : target, out var r)`.

## Step 8 — Squad bars above formations

- `FormationAthleticsView`: player formations = `PlayerTeam.FormationsIncludingEmpty`,
  `CountOfUnits > 0`, `PlayerOrderController.IsFormationSelectable`. Mean/std: already computed
  by step 5 - `AthleticsLogic.TryGetFormationStats(formation, out var f)`, redraw when
  `FormationStatsVersion` moves (band = `f.LowFraction(FormationSpreadStdDevs)` ..
  `f.HighFraction(…)`). Average HEALTH (DESIGN §3 additions) is not computed yet - add it to the
  same refresh pass (`RefreshFormationStats`) rather than a second loop. Position = `MBWindowManager.WorldToScreen(CombatCamera,
  CachedMedianPosition.GetGroundVec3() + (0,0,FormationBarHeight))`, hide when w < 0.
  Anchor via bound `ScaledPosition*Offset` or an own `Widget` subclass (§G, UNVERIFIED #7).
  Implication 8 (`FormationBarsAlways`).

## Step 9 — Orders menu

- Vanilla cards are generated code — cannot be extended without UIExtenderEx (§G).
  Default plan (implication 1): our own compact per-formation panel while
  `Mission.IsOrderMenuOpen`, inside `FormationAthleticsView`. UIExtenderEx satellite only
  if Anton insists on numbers inside the cards (and then test with RTS Camera).
- Numbers: `AthleticsLogic.TryGetFormationStats(formation, out var f)` → `f.Describe()`-style
  "72 ± 8" (use `f.MeanPoints` / `f.StdPoints` directly for the strip).

## Step 10 — Balance + polish

## Step 11 — Steam packaging
