# Done

- [x] **Step 1 — repo, docs, design spec, public GitHub.** Anton's ask of 2026-09-27 turned
  into `docs/DESIGN.md` (behavior + parameter table + the interpretations chosen where the
  ask was ambiguous: a "blow" is any attack, landed or not, `CostOnMiss` toggles it; hero
  multiplier 0.75 — the ask said both 0.75 and 0.5, the leader formula 0.75×0.75×10 settled
  it; party leader = the hero leading the fighter's own party; only blows drain; exhaustion
  is a cliff at 0). `CLAUDE.md` sets the manager protocol Anton asked for: the main session
  manages, ONE agent per step, sequential, every step ends built + tested + documented +
  committed + pushed so a session that runs out of tokens loses nothing. Conventions copied
  from `..\TrainingBattlesMod` (TASKS_TODO / AI_NOTES / TASKS_DONE, Core+Module split,
  decorate-don't-subclass models) plus its most expensive lesson made a hard rule from day
  one: MCM types only in method bodies or a satellite, so the mod loads without MCM. Game
  version pinned: v1.4.8. Public repo: github.com/TraxData313/trax_combat_enhancements.

- [x] **Step 2 — research.** Every hook verified in the decompiled v1.4.8 game and written
  to `docs/RESEARCH.md` (A–I + J hot swap + K logging, Anton's mid-step additions). The
  verdict: **no Harmony, no UIExtenderEx** — the mod needs only public API. Damage: every
  hit (melee, missile, area, charge, fall) funnels through `Mission.GetAttackCollisionResults`
  → armor first, then the non-virtual `AgentApplyDamageModel.CalculateDamage`, whose last
  step `ApplyGeneralDamageModifiers` is where a DECORATOR multiplies the roll; `AddModel<T>`
  hands us `BaseModel` in both campaign and custom battle (`MBGameManager.OnGameStart` runs
  every submodule before building `MissionGameModels`). Speed: a second decorator over
  `AgentStatCalculateModel` scales swing / thrust-and-bow-draw / reload; every game recompute
  (`Agent.UpdateAgentProperties`) passes through it, so the ×0.2 survives weapon switches —
  but the engine clamp is UNVERIFIED, and decorating that model swallows the tournament
  `SetAILevelMultiplier` (non-virtual, private field; War Sails already has the same bug) —
  fix noted. Blows: ranged has `OnAgentShootMissile`; a melee swing has NO event, so poll
  `GetCurrentActionType(1)` for the edge into `ReleaseMelee` (vanilla polls action stages
  per agent itself); landed incl. blocks/parries = `OnMeleeHit`/`OnMissileHit`. Leader:
  `Origin.BattleCombatant as PartyBase` → `LeaderHero` (NOT `General`, which is the ARMY
  leader); custom battle only sets a General on the player's side. Surprise: a MissionView
  added in `OnMissionBehaviorInitialize` is never registered with the MissionScreen (it
  registers views before `AfterStart`) — add views with `MissionScreen.AddMissionView` on
  the first tick; `MissionBattleUIBaseView` gives the create/destroy-on-toggle pattern
  hot swap needs. Surprise two: vanilla HUD and order movies are auto-generated code, so the
  orders-menu cards cannot be extended without UIExtenderEx → recommended our own panel
  while the order menu is open (Anton decides). MCM: fluent builder + `ProxyRef` verified in
  MCM 5.12.3 — edits hit our setters immediately, Cancel undoes through them, Done raises
  `SAVE_TRIGGERED`; format `"none"` keeps config.json the only store; so every parameter can
  be live. Newtonsoft 13.0.1 ships with the game and reads `//` comments (tested). "RCM" is
  not installed — RBM is (its posture/stamina bars are the style reference; playtest with RBM
  off). 13 design implications + 7 proposed parameters await Anton at the top of RESEARCH;
  AI_NOTES steps 3–9 hold the build pointers. (2026.09.27 13.36.27)
